            <h3>What is Diabetic Retinopathy?</h3>
            <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.</p>
            <p>At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. Eventually, it can cause blindness. The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.</p>

            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">No DR</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">No visible signs of diabetic retinopathy. Regular screening is still important.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Mild NPDR</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Characterized by small areas of balloon-like swelling in the retina's tiny blood vessels.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Moderate NPDR</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">As the disease progresses, some blood vessels that nourish the retina become blocked.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Severe NPDR</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">Many more blood vessels are blocked, depriving several areas of the retina of their blood supply.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h5 class="mb-1">Proliferative DR</h5>
                    <p class="mb-1">The most advanced stage. The retina starts growing new blood vessels (neovascularization), which are fragile and can leak blood, potentially causing severe vision problems.</p>
                </li>

            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <p>Our system uses deep learning to analyze fundus images for signs of diabetic retinopathy. Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> EfficientNet B0 - a convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Ensemble Approach:</strong> Multiple models (5-fold cross-validation) vote on the final prediction, increasing accuracy and robustness</li>
                <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Each image is resized, normalized, and prepared for neural network analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Classification:</strong> The system classifies images into five severity levels based on features learned from thousands of training examples</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <p>This tool is for educational and screening purposes only. It is not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis. Some limitations include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image quality affects results - poor quality images may lead to incorrect classification</li>
                    <li>The system only detects diabetic retinopathy, not other eye conditions</li>
                    <li>AI systems can make mistakes - always consult with healthcare professionals</li>
